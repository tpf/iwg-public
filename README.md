# ðŸ§… TPF Infrastructure Working Group

The *Infrastructure Working Group* (IWG) is a committee chartered by [the Perl
Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/) to manage technical
infrastructure, both that used by TPF directly and that which benefits the Perl
and Raku communities.

You might want to read [our charter](/charter.md) or, less likely, our [rules
of operation](/rules-of-operation.md).

Here, more or less, is the pitch that was used to create this group:

Sometimes, individuals or small teams produce work that comes to have value to
Perl or Raku programmers.  With that work effectively delivered, spending time
on it is no longer interesting.  The original authors stop paying attention to
the project, which is now running on a cloud instance somewhere, probably
requiring no maintenance.  Occasionally, it may need to be rebooted, but mostly
it chugs along.  While this is happening, it remains useful, and so its
audience can grow, and now more people rely on this tool, even as its authors
become less interested.  Eventually, the tool falls over and the authors, who
hold the only access to the system, are basically unavailable.

Sometimes, this even leads to some other interested party spinning up a new
install of the original site's software (because it may be open source), but
this can lead to a second collapse, when that second party is no longer
interested.

This means the goals of the IWG include:

*  creating a team who will maintain these systems, keeping them up and running
   as long as they have value, possibly long after the original authors have
   lost interest
*  ensuring that the team itself can have, and does have, rotating membership
   so that we don't realize after four years that everyone on the team designed
   to create continuity has, in fact, vanished into the mist
*  creating an incentive for authors of these tools to hand engage with this
   team so that the project has a chance for continuity from the start;  in
   other words, avoid the TPF-maintained instance from being the second install
   of the tool
*  producing standards of operation for infrastructure so that any new project
   brought under the fold of this team causes as little increase as possible to
   the overall cognitive load of working on this team;  chief among these
   standards must be "sufficient documentation" and "an escrow of privileged
   access to managed systems"
*  establishing the nature of ownership of the project;  for example, can the
   original owner reject changes to the software that the infrastructure team
   judges necessary for ongoing operation?
