# TPF Infrastructure Working Group

## Rules of Operation

1. The IWG will from time to time review its internal goals, proccessess, and
   effectiveness.  These meetings are likely to occur several times a year.  An
   agenda will be distributed one week in advance.  Other business will be
   conducted on an ad hoc basis.

2. The IWG has a private channel (#infrastructure) on the Perl Foundation
   Slack, which is used for realtime discussion of work in progress, such as
   server deployments and upgrades.  It is also used for general discussion,
   but not for voting.

3. The IWG has a publicly-archived mailing list for planning meetings,
   discussing group business, and carrying out votes.

4. All votes will be conducted by secret ballot.

5. Infrastructure standards may be established or changed by either:
  * a statement of support by a majority of working group members
  * a statement of support by two working group members with no objections for one week
  * a vote, with two ballots being sufficient for quorum

6. Votes to add members, remove members, or amend the IWG rules of operation
   require approval of at least half of all eligible voters.

7. One member of the IWG serves as its chairperson.  They are responsible for
   scheduling quarterly meetings and administering votes for adding members,
   removing members, and amending the IWG rules of operation.
