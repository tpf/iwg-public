## 1. Purpose

The Infrastructure Working Group (IWG) is a committee as defined in the Yet
Another Society bylaws, Article IV.  IWG shall manage software services on
behalf of The Perl Foundation (TPF).  It shall be granted all powers granted to
the Board of Directors relevant to these operations except:

* Those that are specifically denied under the Yet Another Society Bylaws.
* The sale or purchase of assets worth greater than $500.
* Borrowing money or assuming any long term liabilities.
* Entering into any contract or agreement worth more than $5,000.

IWG shall be restricted to only those activities that are consistent with Yet
Another Society's tax exempt status.

## 2. Objectives

IWG shall support the following tasks:

1. maintaining software systems to support the operation of TPF
2. maintaining software systems to support the Perl and Raku communities
3. creating and maintaining a standard infrastructure for the hosting of custom
   software systems
4. documenting the operation of infrastructure and systems
5. ensuring that continuity of service for all maintained systems as IWG
   membership changes

## 3. Operating Rules

IWG shall write a set of rules concerning the operation of the committee. This
set of rules shall be published within three months of the IWG's establishment.
The rules shall be attached to this charter as “Exhibit A, IWG Operating
Rules”. The rules shall be subject to review annually, being reaffirmed as part
of the business of the annual meeting required herein. The rules shall be
amended according to the procedure set forth in Exhibit A at other times, when,
in the judgement of the chair, such amendments are needed to support the
effective operation of IWG.

Any rule promulgated under this section, which in the opinion of the Board's
representative on the committee, is potentially harmful to TPF, shall be held
in abeyance until a review by the Board.

## 4. Membership

IWG shall consist of at least four and at most fifteen members. The Board of
Directors shall always have at least one representative on the committee. IWG
shall ensure adequate membership to carry out the tasks specified in Section 2.

The initial membership of IWG shall be appointed by the Board of Directors.
Members shall serve for 1 year terms.  There shall be no limit to the number of
terms any member may serve. At any time, a member can be added, removed, or
replaced by the Board of Directors.

IWG must have the power to appoint and remove its own members under the
guidelines contained in “Exhibit A, IWG Operating Rules”. In the absence of a
rule under the provisions of section 3, the Board of Directors shall have the
discretion to appoint or dismiss members of the committee.

## 5. Meetings & Reports

The members of IWG must meet at least once per quarter. Due to the
international nature of IWG, these meetings will be held via teleconference.

IWG shall provide a report of all recent operations monthly.

## 6. Duration

IWG shall serve until dissolved by the Board of Directors.
